# ü§ù Contributing to Astro Server

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Astro Server as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## üöÄ Quick Start for Contributors

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create your feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
5. **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
6. **Open a Pull Request**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security-First Development

Since this is a security tool, we have strict requirements:

### Security Review Process
- All security-related changes require review by at least 2 maintainers
- New security features must include threat model documentation
- Configuration changes must be tested in isolated environments
- Never commit credentials, keys, or sensitive information

### Testing Requirements
- All scripts must pass shellcheck
- Security configurations must be tested on clean systems
- Ansible playbooks must pass ansible-lint
- Include both positive and negative test cases

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Shell Scripts
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Use strict mode
set -euo pipefail

# Use meaningful variable names
SECURITY_PROFILE="aggressive"
SSH_CONFIG_PATH="/etc/ssh/sshd_config"

# Comment complex logic
# This function validates SSH configuration before applying
validate_ssh_config() {
    local config_file="$1"
    sshd -t -f "$config_file"
}
```

#### Ansible Playbooks
```yaml
---
# Use descriptive task names
- name: Apply SSH hardening configuration with validation
  template:
    src: sshd_config.j2
    dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    backup: yes
    validate: 'sshd -t -f %s'
  notify: restart ssh
```

### Documentation Standards
- Every function must have a comment explaining its purpose
- Complex security configurations need explanation comments
- All user-facing features need documentation updates
- Include examples for new features

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation of what changed and why.

- Include bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues with #123
- Mention breaking changes

Closes #123
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `security`

## üêõ Bug Reports

Great bug reports tend to have:

- **Quick summary** and/or background
- **Steps to reproduce** - be specific!
- **What you expected** would happen
- **What actually happens**
- **System information** (OS, version, etc.)
- **Security context** (if applicable)

### Bug Report Template
```markdown
## Bug Description
Brief description of the issue

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Astro Server Version: 1.0.0
- Installation Method: Git clone / Package / etc.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run `./astro harden`
2. Select profile 'aggressive'
3. See error

## Expected Behavior
SSH should be hardened successfully

## Actual Behavior
Script fails with permission error

## Additional Context
- Running as non-root user with sudo
- Fresh Ubuntu installation
- No custom SSH configuration

## Security Impact
- [ ] This could expose systems to attack
- [ ] This prevents security hardening
- [ ] This is a usability issue only
```

## üí° Feature Requests

We track feature requests as GitHub issues. Great feature requests include:

- **Clear use case** - why is this needed?
- **Security implications** - how does this improve security?
- **Implementation ideas** - any thoughts on how to build it?
- **Compatibility considerations** - what systems should this support?
