## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Before Installation
- [ ] Verify checksums of downloaded files
- [ ] Use official distribution channels only
- [ ] Review source code if building from source
- [ ] Test in non-production environment first

#### During Configuration
- [ ] Use strong SSH keys (RSA 4096+ or Ed25519)
- [ ] Configure firewall before enabling services
- [ ] Use principle of least privilege
- [ ] Enable logging and monitoring

#### After Deployment
- [ ] Regularly update Astro Server
- [ ] Monitor security reports and logs
- [ ] Conduct periodic security audits
- [ ] Keep underlying OS updated

### For Contributors

#### Code Security
- [ ] Follow secure coding practices
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Use parameterized queries/commands
- [ ] Avoid hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Implement proper error handling

#### Review Process
- [ ] All security-related changes require 2+ reviewer approval
- [ ] Run security scanners on code changes
- [ ] Test in isolated environments
- [ ] Document security implications

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Potential Risks

#### Configuration Lockout
- **Risk**: Misconfiguration could lock out legitimate users
- **Mitigation**: Always maintain console/KVM access
- **Recovery**: Documented rollback procedures available

#### Service Disruption
- **Risk**: Aggressive security settings might affect applications
- **Mitigation**: Test configurations in development first
- **Recovery**: Gradual rollback capabilities

#### False Positives
- **Risk**: Fail2Ban might block legitimate traffic
- **Mitigation**: Whitelist known good IPs
- **Recovery**: Manual IP unban procedures

### Limitations

#### Distribution Coverage
- Not all Linux distributions are fully supported
- Some features may not work on older systems
- Custom configurations may be needed

#### Network Environments
- Complex network setups may need manual configuration
- Load balancers and proxies require special consideration
- Cloud environments may have specific requirements
